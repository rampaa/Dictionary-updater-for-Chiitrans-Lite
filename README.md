This batch file updates JMdict and JMnedict for Chiitrans Lite.

In order to use this batch file, you need to install Wget and 7zip and add them to the PATH. You also need to set the path of Chiitrans Lite\data.

If you intend to update your dictionary periodically, creating an automated task for it with Task Scheduler might be a good idea.
