This batch file updates JMdict and JMnedict for Chiitrans Lite.

In order to use this batch file, you need to install Wget and 7zip and add them to the PATH. 

You also need to set the path of your Chiitrans Lite\data to chiitrans_path variable by editing the file itself.

You should run the batch file as administrator. 

Note: If you intend to update those dictionaries periodically, creating an automated task to run this batch file with Task Scheduler might be a good idea.
